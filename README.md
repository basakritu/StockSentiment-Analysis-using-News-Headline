# Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT
 
1. In this section, we take the Reviews dataset and prepare it to train a BERT-based natural language processing (NLP) model. The model will be used to classify customer reviews into positive (1), neutral (0) and negative (-1) sentiment. We convert the original review text into machine-readable features used by BERT. To perform the required feature transformation you will configure an Amazon SageMaker processing job, which will be running a custom Python script.
